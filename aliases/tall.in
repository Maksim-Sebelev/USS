# tall = touch all
# usage: tall
# touch all files in current directory and all subdirs recursive
# why?
# I like to play World of Tanks. I have 2 OS in my pc - windows and ubuntu
# when i switch os on windows to play WoT - the time is shifted forward 3 hours
# so when i switch to ubuntu back, the time remains. i usually forget about this and remebmer after 1-2 hour.
# and when i try to work with my programming projects, after fixing time, i cant use build-system,
# because the time of last file updates is in future. so i need to update time-mark on all projects files.
# so, the solution is - touch all files in projects dir:

alias tall='find . | xargs touch'
